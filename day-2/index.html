    <h1>Object Oriented Programming with JS</h1>
    <p> <strong> Object:</strong> An Object is a unique entity that contains properties and methods. For example “a car” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, type, model, and horsepower and performs certain actions like driving. The characteristics of an Object are called Properties in Object-Oriented Programming and the actions are called methods. An Object is an instance of a class. Objects are everywhere in JavaScript, almost every element is an Object whether it is a function, array, or string. 

        Note: A Method in javascript is a property of an object whose value is a function. 
        
        The object can be created in two ways in JavaScript: <br>
        
       1) Object Literal <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Object Constructor
